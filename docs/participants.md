# 🧪 AI-Guided SIR Modeling Hackathon (2 Hours)

Welcome to the **AI-Guided SIR Modeling Hackathon**!
In this short, hands-on hackathon, you will learn how to **build, simulate, and infer epidemiological models** using **Python, Google Colab, and ChatGPT**.

No prior experience with epidemiological modeling is required.

---

## 🕒 Hackathon Format

- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Style:** Guided, hands-on hackathon (live demo + participant coding)
- **Tools:** Google Colab, Python, ChatGPT
- **Setup required:** None (no local installation)

All coding, debugging, and explanation will be **AI-assisted**, with the host demonstrating how ChatGPT can act as a scientific coding co-pilot.

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

By the end of this hackathon, you will be able to:

- Understand the **SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered)** epidemic model
- Simulate disease outbreaks using **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)**
- Estimate key epidemiological parameters such as:
  - Transmission rate (β)
  - Recovery rate (γ)
  - Basic reproduction number (R₀)

- Fit models to real outbreak data using:
  - Least squares
  - Poisson likelihood

- Use **ChatGPT effectively** for:
  - Writing scientific Python code
  - Debugging models
  - Explaining results
  - Generating clean reports

---

## 📊 Dataset Used in the Hackathon

We will work with **real outbreak data**:

- **Disease:** Measles
- **Location:** Niamey, Niger
- **Source:** Grais et al. (2006)
- **Data type:** Biweekly measles case counts
- **Communities:** 3 (A, B, C)

📌 Important modeling detail:

- Time is measured in **biweeks**
- Average infectious period ≈ **2 weeks**
- This allows us to use a simplified SIR model appropriate for the data

---

## 🤖 How ChatGPT Is Used in This Hackathon

ChatGPT will be used as a **guided assistant**, not as a black box.

You will see how to:

- Ask **clear, precise prompts**
- Specify assumptions (units, data meaning)
- Request verification (plots, sanity checks)
- Iterate safely without rewriting everything

Some ChatGPT interactions will be **pre-recorded** to save time and ensure smooth pacing.

## 🛠 What You Need to Prepare

### Required

- A laptop
- A Google account (for Google Colab)
- A modern web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)

### Not Required

- No Python installation
- No prior knowledge of epidemiology
- No prior experience with ChatGPT

---

## 📁 What Will Be Provided

Before or at the start of the hackathon, you will receive:

- A **Google Colab notebook** (starter template)
- The **Niamey measles dataset**
- A **prompt-engineering cheat sheet**
- All code examples used during the hackathon

You will make your **own editable copy** of the notebook.

## 🧭 Hackathon Agenda (High-Level)

1. Introduction to the hackathon & tools
2. Brief intro to LLMs and ChatGPT for scientific coding
3. Build and simulate an SIR model
4. Estimate R₀ from early outbreak growth
5. Fit model parameters to data
6. Likelihood-based inference (Poisson)
7. Interpreting uncertainty and results
8. Wrap-up and next steps

## 📌 What This Hackathon Is (and Is Not)

✅ This hackathon **is**:

- Hands-on
- Beginner-friendly
- Focused on learning by doing
- Guided step-by-step

❌ This hackathon **is not**:

- A competitive coding contest
- A deep theoretical math course
- A fully automated “push-button” AI demo

---

## 🚀 After the Hackathon

You will leave with:

- A complete, runnable SIR modeling notebook
- A reusable workflow for epidemic inference
- Practical experience using ChatGPT for scientific modeling
- Ideas for extending the model (SEIR, time-varying transmission, Bayesian inference)

---

We look forward to hacking epidemic models **with AI** together.
See you at the hackathon!
